# bruteZip
Bash script that uses 7z tool to crack .zip and .7z password protected archives using a wordlist.

**Usage:**
<pre>
bruteZip.sh protected.zip hugewordlistthatwilltakeforever.txt
</pre>

**TO-DO LIST** (Pull requests are welcome since I'm pretty lazy to implement my to-do lists)
- [ ] Implement pause/resume when hitting CTRL+C
- [ ] Parallelize
- [ ] Make a decent pull request to 7z source code, because this is just a workaround
